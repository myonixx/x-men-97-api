  "synopsis": "The X-Men work to settle the score before it is too late.",
  "plot": "Xavier is met with some distrust, but the X-Men focus on stopping Bastion and convincing Magneto to reverse his blackout. Magneto re-establishes his mutant haven on Asteroid M, choosing to leave Earth without power and reject Xavier's dream of mutant/human co-existence. He invites the X-Men to join him, which Rogue and Roberto do. The rest of the X-Men return to their former base on Muir Island to regroup, before splitting into two teams: Cyclops's Blue Team goes to Asteroid M to confront Magneto while Storm and Jean's Gold Team heads to Bastion's hideout in the Galapagos Islands with a collar that can block Bastion's technopathy, severing his control over the Sentinels. The Gold Team battle Sinister and an army of Sentinels that Bastion is powering himself. Sinister takes control of Cable's mind and uses him to overpower Jean, who sends a desperate psychic message to Cyclops. On Asteroid M, Xavier attempts to take control of Magneto's mind but is blocked. Wolverine stabs and seriously injures Magneto, who begins ripping the adamantium metal from Wolverine's skeleton."
