After gaining information from Thaddeus Ross and Captain America, Rogue finds Gyrich in Mexico and absorbs his memories. Gyrich is killed later that night by a mysterious man, who is working with Sinister. While assisting in the recovery efforts at Genosha, the X-Men are contacted by Trask, who tells them that he is in Madripoor. They get Rogue on the way. Roberto and Jubilee visit Roberto's mother and tell her that he is a mutant. She asks him to keep his identity a secret. In Madripoor, the X-Men learn that Sinister and a mysterious \"OZT\" organization have been developing a highly advanced Sentinel program. Rogue drops Trask to his death, unknowingly activating programming that turns him into a human-Sentinel hybrid. Cable arrives, defeats Trask, and explains that Sinister is working with a greater threat that they must stop. This threat is Bastion, who reveals to Sinister that Xavier is alive in space and that Magneto, presumed dead in the Genosha attack, is also alive and is Bastion's prisoner."
