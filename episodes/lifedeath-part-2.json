  "plot": "During the Kree-Shi'ar War, Lilandra Neramani announces her engagement to Professor Xavier. Refusing to accept her sister marrying a Terran, Deathbird invokes the Rite of M'Dashaa, challenging Xavier to purge all of his memories of Earth to prove his loyalty to the Shi'ar Empire. Xavier's refusal to renounce his memories of the X-Men results in a battle between the Royal Guard and Deathbird until Xavier pulls everyone into an Astral Plane to educate them on coexistence. Upon learning of Gambit's death, Xavier calls off the engagement and requests to return to Earth. In Arizona, Storm and Forge search for a rare cactus to cure Forge of the poison from the Adversary's bite. Storm finds the cactus in a cave, but when she is cornered by the Adversary, she overcomes her fears and regains her powers to defeat the Adversary. Shortly after returning home, Storm and Forge learn of the massacre on Genosha, which is later revealed to have been orchestrated by Mister Sinister."
