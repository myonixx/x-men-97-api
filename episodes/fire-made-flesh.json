  "plot": "The X-Men take in the Jean-lookalike and Beast determines that she is the real Jean Grey. Mister Sinister contacts Jean and reveals her to be a clone. Sinister asserts his control of the clone Jean and she transforms into the Goblin Queen, taking Nathan with her. The Goblin Queen subjects the X-Men to horrific visions before the real Jean awakens and confronts her clone telepathically. Morph leads the X-Men to one of Sinister's laboratories, where they find him afflicting Nathan with a virus in the hope that it will turn him invulnerable. Jean again telepathically confronts the Goblin Queen, reminding her of all the memories they share, both good and bad. The Goblin Queen snaps out of Sinister's control and turns against him, but Nathan is left gravely infected by the virus. Jean and Cyclops send Nathan to the future with Bishop in the hope of finding a cure there, while the Goblin Queen leaves the mansion, taking on the name Madelyne Pryor. In a bar in Texas, Storm meets Forge, who tells her he can restore her powers."
