Support for mutants has grown and the X-Men have become legally sanctioned by the United Nations. The X-Men save a young mutant, Roberto da Costa, from the Friends of Humanity. Seeing that they were outfitted with Sentinel tech, Jean probes Henry Peter Gyrich's mind for the location of the Sentinels creator, Bolivar Trask; Jean receives a horrifying premonition while doing so. The team find Trask at a junkyard in the Sahara, where he is rebuilding his Sentinels with the aid of a lobotomized Master Mold. The X-Men defeat the Sentinels and apprehend Trask. Cyclops and Jean ponder leaving the team so that their son can be raised away from mutant hatred. The following day, Magneto reveals that Xavier willed him control of the Institute, entrusting him with leading the X-Men."
