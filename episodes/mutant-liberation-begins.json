  "synopsis": "When Magneto is forced by the UN to stand trial, a group of anti-mutant rioters test his resolve.",
  "plot": "Magneto, while trying to live up to Charles legacy, has taken on heroism, saving both humans and mutants alike, while refraining from killing anti-mutant militants. Distrustful, Cyclops and Jean stay to keep an eye on Magneto while Rogue sympathizes with his struggles, and hints at a past relationship between them. UN forces led by Valerie Cooper arrive at the X-Mansion to arrest Magneto for his past terrorism. Magneto decides to surrender peacefully, hoping to gain the trust of both the X-Men and humanity in doing so. During his trial at the UN's headquarters, the FoH stage an assault on the building. Their leader, X-Cutioner, attempts to shoot a de-powering radiation blast at Magneto, but Storm takes the hit for him. Magneto stops the assault, after which the UN grant him a pardon, and discuss the possibility of integrating the mutant nation Genosha into the Union. Meanwhile, Jean goes into labor and Rogue is forced to absorb an obstetrician's knowledge when he refuses to deliver a mutant's baby. Jean gives birth to a son, whom she names Nathan. When Beast informs Storm that the radiation blast has de-powered her permanently, she leaves the team, to find new meaning in life. While discussing Storm's decision, the X-Men are surprised by the sudden arrival of a woman who looks identical to Jean."
