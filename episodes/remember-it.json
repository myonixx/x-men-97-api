  "synopsis": "As Genosha prepares to join the UN, select members of the team head to the island nation to be honorees. Back at the mansion, a behind-the-scenes press event risks airing the X-Men's dirty laundry.",
  "plot": "After Genosha is admitted into the United Nations, Magneto, Rogue, and Gambit head to the country, where the latter two are reunited with Madelyne and Nightcrawler. Magneto meets with Genosha's Council (consisting of Madelyne, Banshee, Moira MacTaggert, Callisto, Emma Frost, and Sebastian Shaw), who want him as leader of Genosha; he agrees on the provision that Rogue also leads by his side. Rogue tells Gambit about the plan, and admits her past romantic relationship with Magneto to him. At the inauguration, after Rogue turns down Magneto's proposal, Cable tries to warn of an impending attack, but is transported back to the future but not before Madelyne realizes that he is her son Nathan. Sentinels and Master Mold in a gigantic new body attack Genosha, causing massive death and destruction. Magneto sacrifices his life to save the Morlocks; in retaliation Rogue heads to confront Master Mold but Gambit stops her. After being impaled by one of Master Mold's tentacles, Gambit charges it up with explosive energy, destroying Master Mold but taking his own life in the process. Meanwhile, Cyclops and Jean have remained apart, unable to reconcile their separate lives, and Jean discovers that Cyclops and Madelyne have been communicating telepathically. The X-Men are left stunned by the destruction at Genosha."
