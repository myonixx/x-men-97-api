  "plot": "Cable reveals to the X-Men that in his timeline, Bastion used the Genosha massacre to receive backing for his Prime Sentinel program that resulted in a 300-year war and the enslavement of mutants in a human utopia. Furthermore, a temporal anomaly prevented him from stopping the Genosha massacre. Bastion exposes Xavier's whereabouts in the Shi'ar Empire, inciting an anti-mutant protest outside the X-Mansion. Cyclops, Jean, and Cable travel to Harmony, Pennsylvania, where Jean learns that Bastion was born a mutant after his father was infected with a techno-organic virus sent by Nimrod. Elsewhere, Bastion reveals Operation Zero Tolerance, a program that turns humans into Prime Sentinels. Beast discovers that hundreds of humans have their Sentinel genes awakened and tries to warn the X-Men, but Trish Tilby stops him and reveals herself to be one of them. As the X-Mansion burns to the ground, Wolverine and Nightcrawler protect an unconscious Rogue from an army of Prime Sentinels. After being released by Cooper, Magneto travels to the North Pole and activates a massive magnetic field that shuts down all of the Prime Sentinels. Following the attacks, Xavier returns to Earth and summons all of the X-Men back to the mansion."
